Banco Mais: Marketing Strategy & Predictive Targeting

1. Background and Overview
Banco Mais was struggling with a campaign inefficiency problem. They were calling a lot of customers who weren't interested in their term deposits, leading to mixed results. My goal was to look at their data, find which groups were actually saying "yes," and create a plan to get their success rate above their current 40% baseline.

2. Data Structure Overview
I analyzed a dataset of 10,000 customer records focusing on age, account balances, and whether they already had loans. I followed the 6-step Data Analytics Life Cycle, using Excel to clean the data, run regressions, and make sure the findings were actually reliable before making recommendations.

3. Executive Summary
After looking at the data, I found that Age, Balance, and Loan Status are the three biggest predictors of whether someone will subscribe.

Customers aged 64 and older are the most likely to sign up, with a 51% conversion rate.

On the flip side, people who already have personal loans only convert at 36%, which is below the bank's average.

4. Insights Deep Dive
The Age Factor: Success rates go up as customers get older. The 55+ and 64+ groups are much more interested in these deposits than younger customers.

The Impact of Debt: Having a personal loan is a major "red flag." Calling these customers is largely a waste of time and resources because they convert 4% lower than the average.

Model Reality Check: While age and debt are great starting points, they don't tell the whole story. My analysis showed these are strong signals, but there are definitely other missing factors that influence a customer's final decision.

5. Recommendations
Focus on Older Segments: Shift the marketing effort and budget toward the 55+ and 64+ age groups where the success rate is highest.

Stop Calling Debt-Holders: Implement a rule to exclude anyone with an existing personal loan from the call list to save money and time.

Change the Message: For the older segments, the marketing should focus on security and retirement rather than a generic sales pitch.

Stay Ethical: Make sure the bank uses anonymous IDs and checks the model regularly to ensure we aren't being biased or mishandling private info.
